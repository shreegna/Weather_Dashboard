Weather Dashboard
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that shows real-time weather information for any city entered by the user.
It fetches live data from the Open-Meteo API using JavaScript and displays current weather, hourly forecast, and 7-day forecast. It uses the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to get latitude and longitude and the Open-Meteo Weather API to fetch weather data.
The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for API handling and dynamic updates.
It also includes error handling and responsive design for better user experience.
